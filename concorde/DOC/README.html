Concorde README and Installation guide</h1></center>
This README file is part of the 99.12.15 release of the Concorde. This
is the initial full release of Concorde. More data about Concorde is available
from the <a href="http://www.caam.rice.edu/keck/concorde.html">Concorde
page</a>.
<p>If you would like to be placed on the Concorde mailing
list to receive notifications of updates to the code, please send your
e-mail address to concorde@caam.rice.edu.
<p>Concorde is a computer code for the traveling salesman problem (TSP)
and some related network optimization problems. The code is written in
the ANSI C programming language and it is available for academic research
use; for other uses, contact concorde@caam.rice.edu for licensing options.
<p>Concorde's TSP solver has been used to obtain the optimal solutions
to all TSPLIB instances having up to 13,509 cities.
<p>The Concorde callable library includes over 700 functions permitting
users to create specialized codes for TSP-like problems. All Concorde functions
are thread-safe for prgramming in shared-memory parallel environments;
the main TSP solver includes code for running over networks of unix workstations.
<p>Concorde's documentation is in contained in the DOC directory of the
Concorde distribution, and may be viewed with any web browser. Start with
the file <a href="index.html">index.html</a>. The <a href="http://www.caam.rice.edu/keck/concorde/DOC/index.html">online
version of the documentation</a> may be more current.
<p>The rest of this file contains instructions for unpacking, configuring,
and compiling Concorde.
<p>Concorde is distributed as a gzipped tar file. To unpack, first gunzip
the downloaded file, then use tar to unpack the archive:
<blockquote><tt>$ gunzip co991215.tgz</tt>
<br><tt>$ tar xvf co991215.tar</tt></blockquote>
If you do not have access to gunzip, download the uncompressed distibution
file from the <a href="http://www.caam.rice.edu/keck/concorde.html">Concorde
page</a> and skip the gunzip step.
<p>Unpacking the distribution create a directory, "concorde", and several
subdirectories. To configure, cd into the concorde directory, and run the
configure script:
<blockquote><tt>$ cd concorde</tt>
<br><tt>$ ./configure</tt></blockquote
configure supports several command-line options:
<p><tt>--help</tt> Prints a list of all options configure supports. The last options
are the most pertinent.
<p><tt>--with-cplex</tt> Indicates to use the cplex LP solver. The current default
is to use cplex if the cplex library is available. If no LP solver is available,
the concorde features which require an LP solver will be disabled. In future
versions of concorde, we hope to support other LP solvers.
<p><tt>--with-cplex=DIR</tt> Specifies the directory containing the Cplex callable
library. This directory should contain both the library (<tt>libcplex.a</tt>) and
the header file (<tt>cplex.h</tt>).
<p><tt>--without-cplex</tt> Disables using a cplex LP solver even if one is available.
<p><tt>--enable-ccdefaults</tt> Indicates that a set of default compiler and loader
flags should be used. We use this flag during development to enable useful
optimization and warning options on our development platforms. They may
or may not be useful for you. See also the discussion of CC, CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS,
and LDFLAGS below.
<p><tt>--enable-debugger</tt> Overrides the optimization options set by <tt>--enable-ccdefaults</tt>
to support additional debugging.
<p>configure is also affected by several environment variables. CC controls
which c compiler to use, CPPFLAGS specifies the C preprocessor flags to
use, CFLAGS specifies the C compiler flags to use, and LDFLAGS specifies
loader flags to use. configure generates defaults for all of these variables,
by default using "gcc -g -O2" if gcc is available, and "cc -g" otherwise.
For better performance of the concorde package, set CFLAGS to "-g -O3"
if compiling with gcc, and a strong optimization flag for your compiler
otherwise (typically "-O3", "-O2", or "-xO2"). The method for setting a
environment variable depends on the type of shell you are using. You can
usually find out which kind of shell you are using by typing "echo $SHELL".
Otherwise, try one method and if it doesn't work, try the other. If you
are using sh, bash, ksh, ash, or some other Bourne-like shell, you can
simply set the variables on the command line, for example:
<blockquote><tt>$ CC="gcc" CFLAGS="-g -O3" ./configure</tt>
</blockquote>
If you are using csh, tcsh, or some other C-shell, you set the variables
by using setenv, for example:
<blockquote><tt>$ setenv CC "gcc"</tt>
<br><tt>$ setenv CFLAGS "-g -O3"</tt>
<br><tt>$ ./configure</tt>
</blockquote>
configure determines many features about your operating system and configuration
which it uses to control concorde's compilation. After configure has run,
you should look through the file <tt>INCLUDE/config.h</tt> to make sure it has made
reasonable choices. Then, you can compile concorde by using make:
<blockquote><tt>$ make</tt>
</blockquote>
This builds the concorde library (<tt>concorde.a</tt>), header file (<tt>concorde.h</tt>),
and several executable programs:
<ul>
<li><tt>TSP/concorde</tt> the TSP solver</li>
<li><tt>LINKERN/linkern</tt> the Lin-Kernighan TSP heuristic</li>
<li><tt>CUT/mincut</tt> finds minimum cuts EDGEGEN/edgegen generates
edge sets</li>
<li><tt>FMATCH/fmatch</tt> solves fractional 2-matching problems</li>
<li><tt>LOCALCUT/localcut</tt> an interface to the localcut separation
routine</li>
<li><tt>TOOLS/showres</tt> shows the current state of a branch-and-cut
computation</li>
<li><tt>TOOLS/tourchk</tt> checks the validity of a tour</li>
<li><tt>TOOLS/tourlen</tt> computes the length of a tour</li>
</ul>
There are other programs which are part of concorde, but are for more
specialized computations (such as testing parts of concorde, or network
parallel computation). These may be compiled by:
<blockquote><tt>$ make everything</tt></blockquote>
If you are using Gnu make, then you can separate the build directory
from the source directory. Simply make the build directory, cd into it,
and then run the configure from the source directory. If for some reason
configure cannot figure out where the source directory is, specify it with
the "<tt>--srcdir=DIR</tt>" command line argument. A complete example of unpacking,
configuring, and compiling in a separate build directory, is:
<blockquote><tt>$ gunzip co991215.tgz</tt>
<br><tt>$ tar xvf co991215.tar</tt>
<br><tt>$ mkdir concorde_build</tt>
<br><tt>$ cd concorde_build</tt>
<br><tt>$ ../concorde/configure</tt>
<br><tt>$ make</tt>
</blockquote>
Once again, if you would like to be placed on the Concorde mailing
list to receive notifications of updates to the code, please send your
e-mail address to concorde@caam.rice.edu.
